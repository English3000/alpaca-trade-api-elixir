use Mix.Config

# This configuration is loaded before any dependency.
# If another project depends on this project, this file won't be loaded by it.
# For this reason, if you want to provide default values for your application
# for 3rd-party users, it should be done in your "mix.exs" file.

# You can configure your application as:
#
#     config :alpaca, key: :value
#
# and access this configuration in your application as:
#
#     Application.get_env(:alpaca, :key)
#
# To import configuration files, relative to this directory:
#
#     import_config "#{Mix.env()}.exs"
#
# Configuration from the imported file will override the ones defined here
# (which is why it is important to import them last).
